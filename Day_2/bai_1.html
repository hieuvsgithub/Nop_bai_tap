      <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
      <p>
        This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about a cooking technique called
        <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking you submerge the food
        (usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a wter bath that is precisely
        set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his
        book, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes it as “ultra-low
        temperature poaching”.

        Next month, we will be serving
        <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the
        chef table, contact us before November 30.
