      <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
      <p>
        This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a cooking technique
        called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking you submerge the
        food (usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a wter bath that is
        precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked
        to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes
        it as “ultra-low temperature poaching”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next month, we will be serving
        <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a
        seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.

        Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are
        pregnant or hVE IMMUNITY ISSUES.
